I use stuff like this to make my projects:

[![Stuff](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,html,css,tailwind,js,nuxtjs,vscode,raspberrypi,mongodb,bots,nginx,cloudflare)](https://skillicons.dev)

stuff i like to explore:
- discord bots
- my own website(s)
- working with databases
- hosting a mailserver
- my own url shortner

and basically anything that sparks my interest.

I enjoy Mario Kart, Undertale/Deltarune, Chess, and I used to do card magic at times.
