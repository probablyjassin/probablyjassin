[![Stuff](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=docker,py,js,tailwind,nuxtjs,mongodb,raspberrypi,nginx,cloudflare)](https://skillicons.dev)

things i like to explore:
- discord bots
- my own website(s)
- writing a python library
- working with databases
- hosting a mailserver
- my own url shortner

and basically anything that sparks my interest.

I enjoy Mario Kart, Undertale/Deltarune, Chess, and I do card magic at times.
